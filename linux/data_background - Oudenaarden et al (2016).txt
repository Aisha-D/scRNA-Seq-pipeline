4 donor pancreas were used
Each donor has 8 libraries processed from an endocrine-rich islet extraction: 4 libraries were composed of live cells, 2 were CD24-/TM4SF4+, and 2 were CD24-/TM4SF4-
CD24 and TM4SF4 function as two markers to enrich for alpha and beta cells
TM4SF4, a tetraspanin family member that has been linked to pancreatic development, is used as a marker for alpha cells
